    Updated in SPRING 2022, this template is a “starter kit” for formatting your thesis in \LaTeX.  It incorporates formats for the Table of Contents, List of Tables, and List of Figures. It has correct margins and page numbering, appropriate formatting of the front pages chapter and section headings in acceptable formats, and examples of figures (see section 1.1), equations (section 2.1) and reference citation (section 2.2). It also offers some tips, usually in blue text boxes that can be easily deleted before you print. Delete these blue text boxes once you start working on the section. We suggest that you use the template as a starting point for the format of your thesis if you are using \LaTeX. A similar template for Microsoft word is available. Delete this page by commenting out \verb+\include{doNotInclude}+ in \verb+main.tex+.
